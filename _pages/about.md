* Hello stranger! Welcome to my website :)
* I am a machine learining PhD student in [Torr Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/) at University of Oxford. My supervisor is Professor Philip Torr. Prior to this, I acquired my Bachelor Degree in Engineering in Australian National University. My Honours research advisors are Professor Richard Hartley and Dr. Basura Fernando.
* To learn more about me, you can checkout my list of publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=t6B_Z7MAAAAJ&hl=en), or download my [CV](http://yugeten.github.io/files/CV_06March2019.pdf).
* I feel obligated as a generic 20-something-year-old to also link you to my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jimmyyyyyyshi/?hl=en).
