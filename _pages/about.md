* Hello stranger! Welcome to my website :)
* I am a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. Prior to this, I did my PhD in University of Oxford at [Torr Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/), supervised by Professor Philip Torr and Professor N. Siddharth. Prior to this, I acquired my Bachelor Degree in Engineering in Australian National University. My Honours research advisors are Professor Richard Hartley and Dr. Basura Fernando.
* These days I work on video generative models and world models.
* You can checkout my list of publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=t6B_Z7MAAAAJ&hl=en).
