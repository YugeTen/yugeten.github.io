## Abstract
We introduce a novel Recurrent Neural Network-based algorithm for
future video feature generation and action anticipation called _**feature mapping RNN**_.
Our novel RNN architecture builds upon three effective principles of machine learning, namely parameter sharing, Radial Basis Function kernels and adversarial training. Using only some of the earliest frames of a video, the feature mapping RNN is able to generate future features with a fraction of the parameters needed in traditional RNN. By feeding these future features into a simple multilayer
perceptron facilitated with an RBF kernel layer, we are able to accurately predict the action in the video.

In our experiments, we obtain 18% improvement on _JHMDB-21_ dataset, 6% on _UCF101-24_ and 13% improvement on _UT-Interaction_ datasets over prior state-of-the-art for action anticipation.
